# Curating Your Experience

How you curate your skyline is up to you. Blacksky recommends the following best practices:

{% hint style="info" %}
* Do not use the #AddToBlacksky and #Blacksky hashtags unnecessarily. Hashtags make posts easy to search for, but can also enable misuse.
* You only need to use #AddToBlacksky once to have your posts shown in the feed. We recommend deleting that initial post after you appear on the feed to make it harder to search for and avoid accidental or malicious use.
* Subscribe to and perform a “Block All” using the Green List Feed.
{% endhint %}

If you’ve updated your personal moderation settings to hide sexual content but it’s still appearing in the feeds, you can report the post to the Blacksky Moderation Service to have it removed if it’s spam or have it labeled as sexual content.

You must be subscribed to the Blacksky Moderation Service to do so. To learn more, see the subscription instructions below.
