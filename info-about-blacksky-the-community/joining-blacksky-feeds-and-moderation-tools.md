# Joining Blacksky Feeds and Moderation Tools

### Feeds

There are several feeds created by Blacksky Algorithms:

* [Blacksky](https://bsky.app/profile/rudyfraser.com/feed/blacksky)
* [Blacksky: Trending](https://bsky.app/profile/rudyfraser.com/feed/blacksky-trend)
* [Blackademics](https://bsky.app/profile/rudyfraser.com/feed/blacksky-edu)

{% hint style="info" %}
You may see that the feeds are authored by "@rudyfraser.com". Those are the right feeds.
{% endhint %}

#### Joining a Blacksky Feed

Create a post and include the #AddToBlacksky hashtag (this only needs to be done once). All posts after will be included in the Blacksky feed.

{% code title="Example post" %}
```
This is an example of a post
#AddToBlacksky
```
{% endcode %}

After subscribing, all posts on Bluesky will be labeled with a warning (Warn setting) by default. You can turn this Off or change the Warn to Hide. Selecting Hide will hide any posts with the label from your feeds.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

Labels applied by the tool include:

* **Misogynoir**: Content that expresses hatred, bias, or prejudice against Black women, specifically where racism, sexism, and/or transphobia intersect. This includes sexual harassment, objectification, and targeted attacks on Black womenâ€™s identity or appearance.
* **Antiblack Harassment**: Content that targets individuals or groups based on their Black identity with derogatory, hateful, or dehumanizing language or imagery. This label is applied to content that perpetuates harmful stereotypes, slurs, or direct harassment aimed at Black individuals or communities.
