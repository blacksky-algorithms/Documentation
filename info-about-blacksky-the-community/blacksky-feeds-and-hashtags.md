# Blacksky Feeds and Hashtags

Within Bluesky you can view content based on feeds or by hashtag. It is a common mistake to assume that custom feeds in Bluesky are similar to a subreddit.

{% hint style="info" %}
Custom feeds in Bluesky are aggregators of content, not forums. You cannot post exclusively to any one feed at this time. Learn more about Bluesky feeds: https://bsky.social/about/blog/7-27-2023-custom-feeds
{% endhint %}

So, clicking the #Blacksky hashtag is not the same as using the official Blacksky Feed. The feed is chronologically ordered and the content is curated through human moderation, automation, and some pre-filtering logic.

The community also proactively reports content to our Blacksky Moderation Service: https://bsky.app/profile/blacksky.app. Also see: https://docs.blackskyweb.xyz/docs/blacksky-info/how-to-add
