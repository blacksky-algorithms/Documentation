# Blacksky Community Guidelines

**Effective Date:** January 2025\
**Last Updated:** October 2025



Blacksky is a protected digital space built by Black people, for Black people. These guidelines reflect the clear will of our community, gathered through democratic assemblies where community members shaped what Blacksky should be. They work alongside our [Privacy Policy](https://www.blackskyweb.xyz/about/support/privacy-policy) and [Terms of Service](https://www.blackskyweb.xyz/about/support/tos) to create a safe and empowering environment.



Our foundation is Ubuntu - "I am because we are" - recognizing that our collective safety, joy, and flourishing require intentional boundaries and fierce protection of our space.



***

### 1. Our Purpose

#### This Space Is For Black People

Blacksky exists as a sanctuary for Black voices, experiences, and community. The main Blacksky feed and platform are exclusively for Black people to post, share, and connect.



**Who is welcome:**



* Black people globally, from all parts of the diaspora
* African Americans and descendants of enslaved Africans
* Continental Africans from all nations
* Afro-Caribbeans, Afro-Latinx peoples, Black Europeans, Black Asians
* Biracial and multiracial people who identify as Black
* All shades, all backgrounds, all expressions of Blackness



**Non-Black people** cannot create accounts to post on Blacksky. This boundary is essential to maintaining Blacksky as a space where Black people can exist without performing for, explaining to, or accommodating non-Black audiences.

#### Community Standards&#x20;

Blacksky operates on a principle of good faith. We assume people joining our community are doing so authentically and in alignment with our purpose as a space for Black people. If you observe behavior that seems inconsistent with our community's purpose—including potential digital blackface, bot activity, or other bad faith participation—please report it. Our moderation team will investigate and take appropriate action.

### 4. Moderation

#### Our Approach

Blacksky's moderation team prioritizes Black moderators who understand our cultural contexts and includes diverse representation across queer, trans, and disabled Black experiences throughout the diaspora.\


We use a graduated approach to enforcement:\


* **Immediate Permanent Bans:** White supremacy, CSAM, digital blackface, severe threats
* **Warnings:** First-time guideline violations
* **Temporary Restrictions:** Limited functionality for repeat violations
* **Suspensions:** Temporary account suspension for serious or repeat violations
* **Permanent Bans:** Patterns of harm or severe violations



Context matters. We consider intent, cultural context, and community harm when making moderation decisions.

#### Reporting

If you see content that violates these guidelines:\


1. Use the report button on the post or account
2. Select the most relevant category
3. Provide context if helpful
4. We review all reports promptly



Mass reporting or weaponizing the report system to harass users will result in action against your account.

You can learn more about [Blacksky's moderation practices here](blacksky-moderation.md). All users and services on the AT Protocol can also [subscribe to Blacksky's Moderation labeler](https://blacksky.community/profile/did:plc:d2mkddsbmnrgr3domzg5qexf).

#### Appeals

You may appeal most moderation decisions:\


* Submit an appeal through the platform
* A different moderator will review your appeal
* We aim to respond within 7 days



No appeals are available for: White supremacy, CSAM, digital blackface, or severe threats of violence.

### 5. Privacy and Safety

#### Data Protection

The platform actively resists data harvesting and surveillance by law enforcement. We prioritize your privacy and safety:



* Minimal data collection - only what's necessary to provide services
* Strong encryption and security protections
* User control over your data
* Transparency about what we collect and why
* Clear data retention policies



Review our [Privacy Policy](https://www.blackskyweb.xyz/about/support/privacy-policy) for complete details.

#### Apps and Developer Tools

Apps and developer tools that don't respect user privacy will not be allowed in our ecosystem. Personal Data Servers (PDS) that spread hate speech or spam will be automatically disconnected.

### 6. Subcommunities

#### Using the Blacksky Name

Communities building on Blacksky infrastructure must request permission to use "Blacksky" or "BlackSky" in their community name. This protects our brand and ensures subcommunities align with our values. You can contact us at [hello@blacksky.app](mailto:hello@blacksky.app) to request use.

#### Requirements for Subcommunities

Communities on Blacksky infrastructure must:



* Not promote hate speech, white supremacy, or discrimination
* Clearly communicate their community rules
* Handle reported violations promptly
* Protect member privacy and safety



Subcommunities may:\


* Set their own specific membership criteria
* Create their own posting rules within our framework
* Develop community-specific guidelines
* Moderate their space as they see fit
