# Blacksky Moderation

Any content labeled by Bluesky's AI-based labeler is automatically filtered out of the feed as soon as it is labeled. This usually occurs at the time of posting, but can happen later.

Labels (defined by Bluesky) are annotations on users and content. They can be used to hide, warn, and categorize posts and users on the network. See: https://bsky.social/about/blog/03-12-2024-stackable-moderation

The Blacksky Moderation Service (@blacksky.app) is where you can report posts for antiblackness and misogynoir. The service also functions as a labeler you can subscribe to in order to be warned about harmful or insensitive content. Also see: https://docs.blackskyweb.xyz/docs/blacksky-info/how-to-add#labeler

Other content that doesn't belong in the feed can be reported to @blacksky.app, where a team of moderators will review the content for removal from the feed: https://bsky.app/profile/blacksky.app

Blacksky filters out sexually explicit images based on labels from the official Bluesky Moderation Service (@moderation.bsky.app) for the main Blacksky and Blacksky Trending feeds: https://bsky.app/profile/moderation.bsky.app

We may label the content, add the user to the Green List, and/or prevent the user from viewing the Blacksky feed.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Do not publicly “flag” posts (for example, by reposting them or responding in a reply). Harassers can use that public engagement to target you later or escalate conflict. Use @blacksky.app to report harassers to ensure confidentiality and to protect your peace on Blacksky and Bluesky.
{% endhint %}

If you see something that doesn’t belong in the Blacksky feeds, report it to @blacksky.app:

* Report posts or users for antiblackness or misogynoir: https://bsky.app/profile/blacksky.app
* Report harassment of Black people anywhere on Bluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/blacksky.app
* Report content that could otherwise harm Black people (for example, screenshots of racist posts on other platforms): https://bsky.app/profile/blacksky.app

The moderation service gives you a discrete way to report harmful content and allows Blacksky to enable protective features. For example, the Blacksky “Banned from TV” feature can block certain reported accounts from even seeing the feed.

Any accounts blocked by “Banned From TV” will see the following when trying to load any of the Blacksky feeds:
