<summary>What is the AT Protocol?</summary>

The Authenticated Transfer Protocol (AT Prototcol or atproto) is the decentralized social networking protocol that is used to build open social media applications, like Bluesky.

Here's a [link to a Bluesky blog](https://bsky.social/about/blog/02-22-2024-open-social-web) post that explains what it is and why it differs from other social apps you may be used to.

<summary>How do I report a post to the Blacksky Moderation Service?</summary>

To report a post:

1. Click the "Report Post" (…) icon on the bottom-right corner of the post.
2. For "Why should this post be reviewed?", select a reason. Currently, the only reasons that will allow you to select Blacksky as the moderator are: "Unwanted Sexual Content", "Anti-Social Behavior", "Illegal and Urgent", and "Other".
3. For "Select Moderation Service", select "Blacksky Moderation".
5. Click "Submit Report". If you selected "Other" as your reason, always submit a comment with details so the moderation team has context as to why the post is being reported.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you'd like to also send a report to additional services (for example, the Bluesky Moderation Service), repeat these steps and select the appropriate moderation service from the list of options.
{% endhint %}

<summary>How do I know if I got banned?</summary>

If this is the only post you're seeing in the Blacksky feed, then your access to the feed has been restricted due to suspicion that you are using the feed to target and harass marginalized users. Decisions are final.

<summary>Getting involved with Blacksky</summary>

First, we appreciate you showing interest in contributing to the rsky project!

This project heavily involves the Authenticated Transfer Protocol (AT Protocol or atproto). There are resources attached to this section that you can use to gain a better understanding:

* [ATProto for Distributed Systems Engineers](https://atproto.com/articles/atproto-for-distsys-engineers)
* [AT Protocol Specifications](https://atproto.com/#resources)
* [Official Bluesky PDS (In TypeScript)](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/tree/main/packages/pds)
* [Official Blacksky PDS (In Rust)](https://github.com/blacksky-algorithms/rsky/tree/main/rsky-pds)
* [Bigsky, the official Bluesky Relay](https://github.com/bluesky-social/indigo/tree/main/cmd/bigsky) - This relay can be accessed at https://relay1.us-east.bsky.network/, but the popular option is to use https://bsky.network/.
* [Jetstream, a bandwidth-friendly relay](https://github.com/bluesky-social/jetstream)
* [Official Bluesky Appview](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/tree/main/packages/bsky)
* [Example AppView](https://github.com/bluesky-social/statusphere-example-app/tree/main)
* [Constellation, a global backlink indexing tool](https://github.com/at-microcosm/links/tree/main/constellation)

At a high level, AT Protocol is a generic, federated protocol for building open social media applications. Personal Data Servers (or PDSs) store user data and handle identity. Relays aggregate and distribute data across the network. App Views aggregate data from the relays, for it to be used in feeds.

We understand that not everyone is in a position to give technical contributions to the project. We want to outline some other ways you can contribute. Don't feel pressured if you aren't in a position to participate in upcoming suggestions. Simply giving us a "star" or sharing the word about the project is appreciated.

Some other ways you can contribute to the project include:

* [Financial Contributions](https://opencollective.com/blacksky)
* Updating and/or Translating Documentation
  * Writing Tutorials
  * Adapting the Project for Specific Regions
* Community Support
* Design Elements
  * User Experience
  * User Interface
